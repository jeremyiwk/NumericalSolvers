# Numerical Solvers

### Matthew Kafker, Jeremy Welsh-Kavan

The goal of this project is to build a program for numerically solving various ODEs and PDEs. By validating various numerical methods on DEs with known analytical solutions, we hope to be able to implement these methods for a much larger set DEs.

Most of what we implement here will be informed by the following resources:
